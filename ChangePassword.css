
First Timeout Works: The first time you open the dialog, the countdown starts and finishes correctly, and if the timeout occurs, the dialog closes.

Subsequent Timeouts Don't Work: After the first timeout, if you reopen the dialog, the timer starts, but it immediately reaches 00:00 and the timeout dialog doesn't appear again. This suggests the timer isn't being reset properly or there is an issue with the cleanup of the setInterval and setTimeout logic.
